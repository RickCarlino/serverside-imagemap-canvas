    <H2>What Is This?</H2>
    <P>
      This is mostly satire and partly an exploration of deprecated web technologies. This app uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_map#Server-side">serverside image maps</a> to render a shared canvas that is stored on the server. You should not use this in real-world apps.
    </P>
    <H2>How Do I Use This?</H2>
    <P>
      Clicking on a black pixel turns it white. Conversely, clicking on a white pixel turns it black. The canvas is publicly shared by all app users.
